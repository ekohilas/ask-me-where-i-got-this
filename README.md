<img src="ask_me_where_i_got_this_sticker.svg" alt="sticker design" width="20%"/>

## How do I get this?

You can either ask someone who has one of these stickers, or order your own!

### How do I find someone to ask them where they got this?

These stickers are intended to be shared through interactions at events, if you'd like to find someone to receive from, see the [log below!](#who-has-these-stickers)

### What if I can't find people at these events, can I order my own?
<!-- TODO: Add affiliate link for easy printing -->
Feel free to use the design to print the stickers yourself!

#### How should I order my own?

The first batch of stickers were ordered through [StickerApp](https://stickerapp.com) with the following details:

> **Type**: Die Cut Sticker  
> **Finish**: Vinyl/Matte  
> **Size**: 1.8" width, 2" height  
> **Comment**: Please remove the added padding from the cutline and instead use the original white padding outline from the artwork. Then re-scale the design back to 2" in height.

## Help, I have aquired these stickers, what do I do?
If someone asks you "where did you get that?" give them a handful of stickers to do the same!

## What's the background of this?
"Ask me where I got this" was born in the hallway track at PyConUS in 2025, from a conversation around an attendee asking "where did you get that badge ribbon?".

Quickly the joke was made that the ribbon could say that, and that the person answering the question would take out half their collection to give away to the asker, allowing them to spread the love.

## How was this designed?
The sticker was designed by Evan Kohilas intially using [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/68d33b7f-e6b4-8004-aff9-171c0c9d0e8e), traced into an SVG using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/doc/tutorials/tracing/tutorial-tracing.html), and personalised by hand, such as adding stars, customising the border and outline, and changing the colors to use a [colourblind accessible pallet](https://web.archive.org/web/20250831135507/https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/).

I am not a professional graphic designer by any means, and am open to help with re-designing a better verison. So if you're interested please reach out or make a pull request!
